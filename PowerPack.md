### Power ###

The power pack will consist of 6 C Cell batteries. Each battery is rated for 1.5Volts so the pack will provide a maximum of 9 Volts. The batteries take approximately 6hrs to discharge to a rating of 1 volt a piece, overall voltage of 6volts. Each battery is approximately 1inch wide and 2 inches tall, so the power pack will only be 6”x1”x2” (width x height x depth).
> The battery output voltage will be input into 3 Low Drop Out (LDO) voltage regulators which will be housed in the arm power pack unit as well. The reason LDO’s are being used is because they only require an input to output voltage difference of .9 volts as opposed to the standard linear regulators requiring a difference of 2 volts. The 3 LDO’s that are being used are two 5V LDO’s, and one 3.3V LDO. The reason we are using two 5V LDO’s is because each of the LDO’s can only provide a maximum current of 250mA. The MCU can draw 250mA (max) alone, so one LDO will be used to solely power the [MCU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCU).. The remaining LDO’s will be used to provide power to the remaining parts.
> The power from the arm unit will be sent to the main shuriken via 20AWG wire. This wire is sturdy and rated for enough voltage to power the shuriken.
