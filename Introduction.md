# Project 2: The Shuriken #

# Team Endeavor #
**Introduction:** The goal and objective is to provide a central location for documentation and any pertinent information to be stored on this site for all Team members for Project 2: The Shuriken. [Project Specifications](http://ecen4013.okstate.edu/docs/project2/Shuriken.pdf).

This project goes hand in hand with the Mobile Active Gaming Environment (MAGE) System. The overall intent for the Team is design and build a piece of the MAGE system; the Shuriken weapon. As is discussed in the project specification, the weapon uses an infra-red (IR) to shoot data packets that send/receive information to the server and then to the database. The communication was wireless using an XBee radio.
