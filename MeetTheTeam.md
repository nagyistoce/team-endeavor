**Benjamin Lozano-Project Manager**<br />Puttin’ the ‘elation’ in ‘Public Relations’

Enjoys walks in the woods without the spider web interference, mud or stray rabid dogs. Listens occasionally to Tuvan throat-singing angels. Tries to overstand the Supreme Mathematics. Past accomplishments include ollieing out picnic tables, sock folding and birdhouse manufacture. Hopes to one day learn how to tie ties and sharpen knives properly. Relaxes by studying urban exploration, drinking limeade or a Dr. Thunder.

**James Bellamy-Lead Technical Engineer**<br />A man of mystery and power, whose power is exceeded only by his mystery.

Brought up from humble beginnings, James had begun to show explosive academic progress, James's teachers finally lost patience with his endless shenanigans. His timing of an animal-release "prank" was most unfortunate. When James suddenly let a rabid skunk loose from his lunchbox and then began to dance an improvised Irish jig in order to induce the animal to hiss and spray, he was summarily expelled from The Kambridge Academy.

Yea, though I walk through the valley of death, I will fear no evil, for I am the meanest sonofabitch in the valley.

**Caitlin Guthrie-Design Engineer**<br />Living one day at a time, with a fresh baked cookie. Okay.  And with a coffee.  And maybe some chocolate. But I promise to take my vitamins.

I am a Oklahoman, born and bred, and I have always lived here, never moved away. This should actually tell you a lot about me, such as, I have a sense of humor and I am basically a good, down-to-earth person. But, being a Oklahoman means you are waiting for the other shoe to drop, pretty much always... after all, our sports teams for my whole life have either done one of two things... 1) lost the game / series / playoff in a clutch situation, or 2) just plain sucked.

Generally Oklahoman people such as myself are easygoing and not pretentious, we value home and family and work and play, and basically don't have super-high expectations, which means we can have a pretty enjoyable life (unless that other shoe drops!)

**Connor Ledgerwood-Design Engineer**<br />I recently gave up Warcraft so my productivity, and drinking, have increased dramatically.

I can bake 5 minute brownie mix in 3 minutes.
