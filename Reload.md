Tactile push button switch
  * Switch will need to be pressed while reload process occurs.<br />
  * Releasing the switch ends the reload process.<br />
  * Switch will be located in an easily accessible spot on the shuriken.<br />
  * When switch remains open, power will not be consumed by push button switch or MCU.<br />
  * When switch is pressed in, a 5V signal will be sent to MCU indicating that the reload process is initiated.<br />
  * All process will be handled by MCU.<br />
  * Actuation force of 160G is the same force needed to press a key on a keyboard.<br />
  * Approximate price of push button switch is $.65<br />
  * With only a 4mm required clearance on top of the PCB, this switch will still allow shuriken to remain thin.<br />
