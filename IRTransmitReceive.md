### IR Transmit/Receive ###

> The Shuriken will have at least one IR transmitter (LED), located in the front tip of the case (farthest from person) and two IR receivers located in the two tips perpendicular to the transmitter. The IR transmitter will be limited from 5 feet to 25 feet; this limitation will be determined by the throw strength.
> The [IR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared). Handler (code inside the PIC) will take in a signal from Motion Handling; this signal will be interpreted by the IR Handler to determine the distance the IR packet will be transmitted. The IR Handler will then encode a binary packet and send it off to be transmitted through the IR [LED](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode).. The packet will be a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal at 56 kHz and consist of 1’s and 0’s.
To limit the physical distance of the packet, a PIC > a 2:4 demultiplexer > MOSFET > resistor > [LED](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode). combo will be implemented. The PIC will output two selection bits and a PWM Vdd which will input into the demultiplexer, the demux will then select between 4 outputs, the corresponding output from the demux will then input into a MOSFET to amplify the current, the output from the [MOSFET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET). will then input to a certain resistor value limiting the current to the IR LED. By limiting the current to the LED effectively lowers the radiant intensity of the LED thus limiting the range of the transmission.
> The [IR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared). receiver is an active LOW [IR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared). detector; this means when it detects an IR packet the detector outputs a low signal to the PIC. The packet is then interpreted by the IR Handler; it is read in bit by bit (24 bits total) and checked to ensure a proper packet has been received. If the packet is correct it is transmitted to the HIU through the communication channel. The detector already filters out most ambient noise; this ensures that only a 56 kHz signal triggers the detector.
